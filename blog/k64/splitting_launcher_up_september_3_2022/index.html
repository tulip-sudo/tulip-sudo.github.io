			<h1>Splitting Launcher Up</h1>
			<p>
			I have decided to split up the launcher into two seperate projects. <br>
			The launcher itself is the first project and only will have slight modifications. <br>
			The second project is Library Super Mario Sixty Four PC Launcher Backend (lib name: libsmsfpclauncherbackend). <br>
			This will be a changed version of the Kirigami64 backend (which stored important information about builds). <br>
			Hopefully implementing this won't take too long.
